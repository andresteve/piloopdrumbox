Raspberry pi + drum pad + loop station

## Update: 13 december 2020
<p>I got a Raspberry Pi this month to start my looper/drumbox project. I want to make a loop station including a drum box, which can connect to my keyboard and loop over both the drum box and the music input. Obviously, it should also include an output jack to output the loop. After a bit of searching, <a href="https://youtu.be/_nBK8sAl9nw">this</a> video turned out to be a nice inspiration, except for all the fancy synth buttons and effects, as those will come out of my keyboard anyway. See the Wiki for more info</p>
