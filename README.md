# piloopdrumbox
Welcome to my repo for the ultimate Raspberry pi + drum pad + loop station.  
For updates on the build log see the [wiki](https://github.com/roberthofman/piloopdrumbox/wiki).   

## Install requirements
### PureData
On the pi, use the command:  
`sudo apt-get install puredata`  
No extensions are required. 

### Python
The Python code is based on Python3. Make sure you have installed the packages to work with GPIO pins:  
`sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio`

### Drum sounds
I added a couple drum sounds. You can add additional .wav files following the number sintax in the folder.
